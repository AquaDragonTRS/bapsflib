Opening an HDF5 file using the :py:class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.files.File`
class is done in the same manner as :py:class:`h5py.File`, since
:py:class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.files.File` acts as a wrapper around
:py:class:`h5py.File`.  :py:class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.files.File` adds
methods and attributes specifically for manipulating data from the Large
Plasma Device (LaPD), as well as, opening the HDF5 file as 'read-only'
by default.

To open a LaPD generated HDF5 file

    >>> from bapsflib import lapdhdf
    >>> f = lapdhdf.File('test.hdf5')
    >>> f
    <HDF5 file "test.hdf5" (mode r)>

which is equivalent to

    >>> import h5py
    >>> f = h5py.File('test.hdf5', 'r')
    >>> f
    <HDF5 file "test.hdf5" (mode r)>

Upon opening a file, :py:class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.files.File` generates
an instance of :py:class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.hdfchecks.hdfCheck` that
calls :class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.hdfmapper.hdfMap` and reports the
results of the file mapping generated.
:class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.hdfmapper.hdfMap` maps the file by comparing
the file's structure to known structures of a file generated by the
LaPD DAQ system, see :ref:`file_mappings`.
