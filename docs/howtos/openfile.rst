Opening an HDF5 file using the :py:class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.files.File`
class is done in the same manner as :py:class:`h5py.File`, since
:py:class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.files.File` acts as a wrapper around
:py:class:`h5py.File`.  :py:class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.files.File` adds
methods and attributes specifically for manipulating data from the Large
Plasma Device (LaPD), as well as, opening the HDF5 file as 'read-only'
by default.

To open a LaPD generated HDF5 file

.. code-block:: python

   from bapsflib import lapdhdf

   f = lapdhdf.File('test.hdf5')

which is equivalent to

.. code-block:: python

   import h5py

   f = h5py.File('test.hdf5', 'r')

Upon opening a file, :py:class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.files.File` generates
an instance of :py:class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.hdfchecks.hdfCheck` that
compares the structure of the loaded file to known structures/mappings
of a file generated by the LaPD DAQ system, see :ref:`file_mappings`.
