An overview of an opened HDF5 file can be obtained using the object
property :attr:`overview`, which returns an instance of
:class:`~bapsflib.lapdhdf.hdfoverview.hdfOverview`.  For example, ::

    >>> # open file
    >>> f = lapdhdf.File('test.hdf5')
    >>> f.overview
    <bapsflib.lapdhdf.hdfoverview.hdfOverview>
    >>>
    >>> # print the overview
    >>> f.overview.print()

The overview report is constructed from the :class:`hdfMap` class and
will thus report...

* general info on the HDF5 file
* experimental run info
* discovered MSI diagnostics, digitizers, and control devices
* the device configurations for each MSI diagnostic, digitizer, and
  control device

This instance is
generated every time :meth:`overview` is called so it will have any
updates made to the mapping classes.
