Contributing to bapsflib
========================

:mod:`bapsflib` is an open-sourced Python package for the Basic Plasma Science Facility (BaPSF) and is built upon the contribution of the users it serves. It is dependent on user feedback to make improvements to the package and these contributions, no matter how small, are integral to the development of new features and tools for the convinience of its users.

In short, we want your help improving the :mod:`bapsflib` package.

For a start, check out our `list of issues <https://github.com/BaPSF/bapsflib/issues>`_ if you wish to begin working on something. You'll need to have a GitHub account and you `can make one for free <https://github.com/join?source=header-home>`_ if you do not already have one. 

If you are new to `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, some helpful resources include documentation on `git basics <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics>`_ and an `interactive git tutorial <https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1>`_.  You would also need a way to manipulate the source files, either by `installing git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_ or working through the `GitHub GUI <https://desktop.github.com/>`_ locally on your computer.

Alternatively, if you have an issue which you would like to raise directly to the development team, you can contact:

* Erik T. Everson (eteverson@gmail.com, GitHub: `rocco8773 <https://github.com/rocco8773>`_)
* Stephen Vincena (vincena@physics.ucla.edu, GitHub: `svincena <https://github.com/svincena>`_)


General Guidelines and Workflow

* Look up the manual of style on guidelines for coding (to be written)


Tutorial: Creating an Issue Discussion on GitHub
------------------------------------------------
Creating an issue is a very straightforward process and is typically the default option to go to if you want to raise an issue for discussion. No coding is required to raise an issue. This process is suitable for:

* Reporting bugs or errors
* Suggesting features to be implemented
* Requesting help for coding or writing documentation
* ...

Tutorial: Creating a Pull Request on GitHub
-------------------------------------------
A pull request is slightly more complicated than raising an issue. Typically, the user has to present code edits that are proposed to be merged into the package. There are also draft pull requests where the user can present incomplete code edits and have other users comment on them. This process is suitable for:

* Making code edit suggestions
* Developing new routines to be incorporated into the package
* ...
