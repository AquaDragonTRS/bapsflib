Contributing to bapsflib
========================

:mod:`bapsflib` is an open-sourced Python package for the Basic Plasma Science Facility (BaPSF) and is built upon the contribution of the users it serves. It is dependent on user feedback to make improvements to the package and these contributions, no matter how small, are integral to the development of new features and tools for the convinience of its users. ...

In short, we want your help improving the :mod:`bapsflib` package.
