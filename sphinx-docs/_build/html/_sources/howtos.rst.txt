Opening a file
--------------

Opening an HDF5 file using :py:class:`bapsflib.lapdhdf.File` is done in
the same manner as :py:class:`h5py.File`, since
:py:class:`bapsflib.lapdhdf.File` inherits from :py:class:`h5py.File`.
The key difference is the default behavior for
:py:class:`bapsflib.lapdhdf.File` is to open the file in a 'read-only'
mode.

.. code-block:: python

   from bapsflib import lapdhdf

   f = lapdhdf.File('test.hdf5')

which is equivalent to

.. code-block:: python

   import h5py

   f = h5py.File('test.hdf5', 'r')

Upon opening a file, :py:class:`lapdhdf.File` generates an instance of
:py:class:`lapdhdf.hdfchecks.hdfCheck` that compares the structure of
the loaded file to known structures generated by the Large Plasma Device
(LaPD) DAQ system.
